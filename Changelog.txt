Gonna say this: I ain't going back and trying to remember what the shit I did before. This is only a changelog of changes going forward.

18/12/2025
- Fixed "shove" actions unable to be sent
	↳ Actions passed through executePhase are copied into a local variable before passing so they can be altered
	↳ TODO: Do the same within the "shove" action itself so that one can call its .exe without it altering the sent action list

- Added golems back into the starting position

- Added simultaneous convert detection, behaviour now mimics "move" action in how multiple actions targeting the same square cancel out


19/12/2025
- Added newGame function to make resetting gamestate easier

- Allowed actions to be deleted from phases other than the currently selected phase

- Dimmed board when actions are sent

- Added "game over" window. (no functionality yet)
	↳ Made it invisible to avoid confusion
