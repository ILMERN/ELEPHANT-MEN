Gonna say this: I ain't going back and trying to remember what the shit I did before. This is only a changelog of changes going forward.

- Fixed "shove" actions unable to be sent
	↳ Actions passed through executePhase are copied into a local variable before passing so they can be altered

-------------------- COMMIT --------------------

- TODO:
	↳ Add player-visible console to track/explain all actions
	↳ Handle disconnections
	↳ Game ends when a player runs out of pieces
	↳ Add a ton of comments in my code
	↳ Write the README

- Potential ideas:
	↳ Add draw state: 7 turns without any piece losing HP
	↳ Rework favour
		↳ Hitting an enemy gives you favour equal to damage dealt
		↳ Reduce favour given upon kill to 2
		↳ Convert gives favour equal to target's remaining health + kill favour
	↳ Change starting position
		↳ Move back soldier and back monk up one space to bring them in line with forward soldiers
