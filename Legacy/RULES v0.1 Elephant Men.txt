______ELEPHANT MEN______

	~~SETUP~~
White pawns (soldiers) on c3, d3, and f3
White bishop (monk) on e3
Black pawns (soldiers) on c6, e6, and f6
Black bishop (monk) on d6

Favour counter set to 0

	~~PLAY~~
Each turn, both players choose 3 actions for their units to perform. These actions are revealed simultaneously and in sequence.

Phase 1: Player 1 and Player 2's 1st action are performed simultaneously
Phase 2: Player 1 and Player 2's 2nd action are performed simultaneously
Phase 3: Player 1 and Player 2's 3rd action are performed simultaneously

	~~FAVOUR~~
Favour is a resource balanced between the two players (tug of war), tracked by a single number. If white gains Favour, the counter increases by 1. If black gains favour, the counter decreases by 1. Favour can be gained in two ways: eliminating/converting enemy units (gains 3 favour) or [Pray]ing with a monk (gains 1 favour). Eliminating an allied unit will grant the opponent 3 Favour. If Favour is at least +7 or -7 at the end of a phase, the player who gained that favour wins. A player can also win by eliminating/converting all enemy units.

	~~AVAILABLE ACTIONS~~

SOLDIER (3HP)
[Move]
[Poke]
[Cleave]

MONK (2HP)
[Move]
[Pray]
[Convert]

Note: if a unit's health reaches 0, that unit is immediately removed from play.

	~~ACTION NOTATION~~
(examples in brackets)
[Move]:			[unit]>[target]		(c3>c4)
[Poke]/[Convert]:	[unit].[target]		(c4.d5)
[Cleave]:		[unit]x[target]		(c4xd4)
[Pray]:			[unit] p		(e3 p)

	~~ACTION DETAILS~~
[Move]
 -Unit targets and moves one space in one of the 4 cardinal directions. [Move] fails if target space is either the target of another unit's [Move] command or is occupied this phase (unless that unit is [Move]ing to another space).

[Poke]
 -Unit targets a space either 2 spaces away in one of the 4 cardinal directions or 1 space away diagonally. If a unit is in the targeted space, that unit takes 1 damage. Otherwise, this unit cannot act next phase (it is resting). [Poke] misses if the unit in the targeted space [Move]s this phase. [Poke] hits if a unit [Move]s into the targeted space this phase.

[Cleave]
 -Unit targets a space 1 space away in one of the 4 cardinal directions. On the next phase, any unit in the targeted space takes 2 damage. Unlike [Poke], [Cleave] will cause this unit to rest whether it hits or misses.

[Pray]
 -Player controlling this unit gains 1 favour. This unit must rest and is unable to act next phase.

[Convert]
 -Unit targets a space either 2 spaces away in one of the 4 cardinal directions or 1 space away diagonally. If an enemy unit is in the targeted space, that unit becomes an allied unit. Whether [Convert] hits or misses, this unit does not have to rest and can act next phase.

	~~INTERRUPTING ACTIONS~~
All actions can be interrupted if the acting unit is targeted by another action with a higher priority (listed below). Actions will not be interrupted by an equal action (e.g. if two soldiers [Poke] each other, they will both take 1 damage). If an action would cause a unit to rest but is interrupted before it can do so, it will not have to rest (e.g. if a soldier [Poke]s a [Pray]ing monk, that monk will gain no favour but may move next phase).

	~~ACTION RESOLUTION ORDER~~

1. Move
2. Poke
3. Convert
4. Cleave
5. Pray
