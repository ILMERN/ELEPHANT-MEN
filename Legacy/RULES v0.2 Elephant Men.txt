	~~SETUP~~

Favour counter set to 0

	~~PLAY~~
A turn consists of 3 phases enacted sequentially. Before the turn begins, each player chooses 3 actions for their units to perform. Actions can be performed on any of the 3 phases. A player may command multiple units to act in a single phase, but each unit may only perform 1 action per phase. This limit doesn't apply to a turn; a unit may act 3 times in one turn, once in each phase.

Once both players have chosen their 3 actions, they are revealed simultaneously. The order units move is determined by the action taken, listed at the bottom of these rules in the ACTION RESOLUTION ORDER section.

	~~FAVOUR~~
Favour is a resource balanced between the two players (tug of war), tracked by a single number. If white gains Favour, the counter increases by 1. If black gains favour, the counter decreases by 1. Favour can be gained in two ways: eliminating/converting enemy units (gains 3 favour) or [Pray]ing with a monk (gains 1 favour). Eliminating an allied unit will grant the opponent 3 Favour. If Favour is at least +7 or -7 at the end of a phase, the player who gained that favour wins. A player can also win by eliminating/converting all enemy units.

	~~AVAILABLE ACTIONS~~

SOLDIER (3HP)
[Move]
[Poke]
[Cleave]

MONK (2HP)
[Move]
[Pray]
[Convert]

Note: if a unit's health reaches 0, that unit is immediately removed from play.

	~~ACTION NOTATION~~
(examples in brackets)
[Move]:			[unit]>[target]		(c3>c4)
[Poke]/[Convert]:	[unit].[target]		(c4.d5)
[Cleave]:		[unit]x[target]		(c4xd4)
[Pray]:			[unit] p		(e3 p)

	~~ACTION DETAILS~~
[Move]
 -Unit targets and moves one space in one of the 4 cardinal directions. [Move] fails if target space is either the target of another unit's [Move] command or is occupied this phase (unless that unit is [Move]ing to another space).

[Poke]
 -Unit targets a space either 2 spaces away in one of the 4 cardinal directions or 1 space away diagonally. If a unit is in the targeted space, that unit takes 1 damage. Otherwise, this unit cannot act next phase (it is resting). [Poke] misses if the unit in the targeted space [Move]s this phase. [Poke] hits if a unit [Move]s into the targeted space this phase.

[Cleave]
 -Unit targets a space 1 space away in one of the 4 cardinal directions. On the next phase, any unit in the targeted space takes 2 damage. Unlike [Poke], [Cleave] will cause this unit to rest whether it hits or misses.

[Pray]
 -Player controlling this unit gains 1 favour. This unit must rest and is unable to act next phase.

[Convert]
 -Unit targets a space either 2 spaces away in one of the 4 cardinal directions or 1 space away diagonally. If an enemy unit is in the targeted space, that unit becomes an allied unit. Whether [Convert] hits or misses, this unit does not have to rest and can act next phase.

	~~INTERRUPTING ACTIONS~~
All actions can be interrupted if the acting unit is targeted by another action earlier in the phase. Actions will not be interrupted by an equal action (e.g. if two soldiers [Poke] each other, they will both take 1 damage). If an action would cause a unit to rest but is interrupted before it can do so, it will not have to rest (e.g. if a soldier [Poke]s a [Pray]ing monk, that monk will gain no favour but may move next phase).

	~~ACTION RESOLUTION ORDER~~

1. Move
2. Poke
3. Convert
4. Cleave
5. Pray
